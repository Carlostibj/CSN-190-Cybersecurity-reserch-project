Summary: The malware sandbox scores slightly higher due to my stronger technical interest and alignment with cybersecurity-analysis career goals.
Part C: Final Topic Selection
Final Choice: Building a Malware Sandbox Environment
Why This Topic:
This topic balances hands-on technical work with practical cybersecurity relevance. Creating a sandbox offers a controlled way to study malware behavior, network activity, and system impact without risking real systems. It is achievable within 10 weeks using open-source tools like Cuckoo and REMnux while still challenging me to master automation and virtualization security. The project connects directly to my goal of becoming a Cybersecurity Analyst or Incident Responder who can analyze and respond to threats efficiently.
Three-Tier Plan
Ambitious Goal: Develop a sandbox with anti-evasion detection, automated reporting, and integration with threat intelligence feeds.
Realistic Target: Operational sandbox analyzing Windows/Linux malware with report generation.
Minimum Viable Outcome: Secure virtual environment isolating and logging file and network behavior for sample malware.
Learning Value
This project builds core skills in virtualization, automation, network monitoring, and malware analysis, essential for SOC and threat research roles. Even if not fully complete, it will demonstrate competence in system hardening, logging, and safe testing, key abilities for any security professional.

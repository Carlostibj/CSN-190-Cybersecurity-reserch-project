### Topic 1: Building a Malware Sandbox Environment
GitHub Project 1
Citation (APA): cuckoosandbox. (n.d.). Cuckoo Sandbox. GitHub. https://github.com/cuckoosandbox/cuckoo
Type: Security Tool / Dynamic Malware Analysis Framework
Synopsis:
Cuckoo is the most widely used open-source malware sandbox. It allows analysts to submit files or URLs to a VM, where it monitors process behavior, API calls, file modifications, registry changes, and network traffic. The tool generates structured reports with indicators of compromise (IOCs). It is actively maintained, with ~6.5k stars, ~1.4k forks, and last updated in 2023. Limitations: malware with strong anti-VM detection may evade analysis.

Relevance: 5/5 – Core reference implementation for malware sandboxing and an excellent foundation to study or extend.

GitHub Project 2
Citation (APA): CERT-Polska. (n.d.). drakvuf-sandbox. GitHub. https://github.com/CERT-Polska/drakvuf-sandbox
Type: Research Implementation / Agentless Sandbox
Synopsis:
DRAKVUF Sandbox is an automated malware analysis system built on the DRAKVUF hypervisor introspection engine. Unlike traditional sandboxes, it requires no in-guest agent, making it harder for malware to detect. It provides a web interface for uploading files and generates detailed reports. It has ~1.1k stars, ~240 forks, and was last updated in 2024. Limitations: setup is complex (requires Xen hypervisor) and resource-intensive.
Link: https://github.com/CERT-Polska/drakvuf-sandbox
Relevance: 4/5 – Highly relevant for research into stealthier, anti-evasion sandboxing approaches.


### Topic 2: Digital Evidence Collection for Mobile Devices

GitHub Project 1 Citation (APA): mvt-project. (n.d.). Mobile Verification Toolkit (MVT). GitHub. https://github.com/mvt-project/mvt Type: Forensic Utility / Research Tool Synopsis: MVT automates mobile evidence collection and compromise detection for Android and iOS devices. It extracts system logs, installed apps, and artifacts, and compares them against known indicators (e.g., Pegasus spyware). Used by Amnesty International in real investigations. It has ~3.8k stars, ~600 forks, and is actively updated (2025). Limitations: requires command-line knowledge and sometimes root/jailbreak access. Link: https://github.com/mvt-project/mvt Relevance: 5/5 – Directly supports defensible mobile evidence gathering with real-world case use. GitHub Project 2 Citation (APA): scorelab. (n.d.). OpenMF. GitHub. https://github.com/scorelab/OpenMF Type: Mobile Forensics Framework / Educational Project Synopsis: OpenMF is an open-source mobile forensics framework for Android. It enables acquisition of files, app data, and databases, and generates HTML reports for analysis. Designed for researchers and students to learn mobile forensics practices. The project has ~240 stars, ~100 forks, and last update was in 2022. Limitations: Android-only and some modules remain experimental. Link: https://github.com/scorelab/OpenMF Relevance: 4/5 – Useful baseline for educational and research purposes, though less mature than commercial tools.

Comparison Notes: Malware Sandbox Cuckoo: Mature, widely used, extensible; better for practical deployment. DRAKVUF Sandbox: More complex, research-focused; stronger against evasion. Takeaway: Cuckoo is ideal for building a working sandbox; DRAKVUF highlights advanced anti-evasion techniques. Mobile Forensics MVT: Modern, real-world impact, supports both iOS/Android; highly practical. OpenMF: Educational, Android-only, good for learning; less suited for production. Takeaway: MVT is better for real investigations, while OpenMF is useful for structured academic learning.

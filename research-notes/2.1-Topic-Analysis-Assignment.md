### Topic 1: Building a Malware Sandbox Environment
### Initial Interest
Level 9/10 – I’m highly interested because malware analysis is a critical skill in cybersecurity. I want hands-on experience understanding how malicious code behaves in controlled environments.
### Feasibility Assessment
- Resources/Tools Needed: A virtualized lab setup (VirtualBox, VMware, or Hyper-V), malware samples (from repositories like MalwareBazaar or VirusShare), monitoring tools (Wireshark, ProcMon, Process Explorer, etc.), and safe OS images (Windows/Linux).
- Current Knowledge Level: I have a solid foundation in networking, system administration, and basic security concepts, but I have limited direct malware analysis experience.
- What I Need to Learn: Advanced malware analysis techniques, setting up secure sandboxing environments, and using tools like Cuckoo Sandbox or REMnux.
### Project vs Research Classification
- Classification: Primarily project-based.
- Deliverable: A fully functioning malware sandbox environment with documentation on configuration, testing, and analysis procedures.
### Real-World Application
- Cybersecurity Challenge Addressed: Malware continues to be one of the most prevalent threats, impacting businesses and individuals daily. Sandboxes allow analysts to safely study new malware strains.
- Industry Need Fulfilled: Organizations need rapid, secure methods to analyze and respond to new malware variants.
### Potential Career Connection
- Career Alignment: Directly aligns with my goal of becoming a cybersecurity analyst, especially in SOC (Security Operations Center) or incident response roles.
- Skills Developed: Malware analysis, system hardening, virtualization, network monitoring, and technical documentation.

### Topic 2: Digital Evidence Collection for Mobile Devices
### Initial Interest
Level 8/10 – I find digital forensics fascinating, especially as mobile devices are now central to both personal and corporate activity. This topic feels practical and valuable for investigations.
### Feasibility Assessment
- Resources/Tools Needed: Mobile forensic tools (Autopsy, Cellebrite UFED demo version, Magnet AXIOM trial, or open-source tools like Andriller), test smartphones, and secure storage for evidence.
- Current Knowledge Level: Basic understanding of digital forensics concepts, but limited exposure to mobile-specific forensic processes.
- What I Need to Learn: Chain of custody procedures, mobile data acquisition methods (logical vs. physical extraction), and forensic reporting standards.
### Project vs Research Classification
- Classification: Project-based.
- Deliverable: A digital evidence collection toolkit or framework, with documentation showing procedures for mobile evidence acquisition and preservation.
### Real-World Application
- Cybersecurity Challenge Addressed: Mobile devices are frequent targets for attacks, and they often hold critical evidence in investigations ranging from fraud to insider threats.
- Industry Need Fulfilled: Law enforcement, corporate security, and compliance teams need reliable, forensically sound methods of mobile data collection.
### Potential Career Connection
- Career Alignment: Supports my long-term interest in cybersecurity with possible specialization in digital forensics or incident response.
- Skills Developed: Forensic methodology, evidence preservation, legal standards, and analytical thinking applied to real-world investigations.

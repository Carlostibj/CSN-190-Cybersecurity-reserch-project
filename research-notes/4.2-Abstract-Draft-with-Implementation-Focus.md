### Abstract: Building a Malware Sandbox Environment


Malware continues to be a dominant cybersecurity threat, evolving with sophisticated evasion techniques that make detection and analysis increasingly difficult. Traditional antivirus tools struggle to identify novel or polymorphic malware in real time, highlighting the need for secure and automated analysis environments. This project develops a virtualized malware sandbox designed to safely execute and observe malicious files, capturing behavioral, network, and system-level indicators without endangering production systems. The sandbox will be built using VirtualBox, Cuckoo Sandbox, and REMnux tools, configured with isolated Windows and Linux environments. Key features include automated sample submission, network monitoring through Wireshark, and detailed behavior reports generated by Cuckooâ€™s analysis engine. The system will be tested using a controlled dataset of malware samples to measure detection accuracy, isolation effectiveness, and reporting completeness. Expected outcomes include a documented sandbox architecture, demonstration of secure malware execution, and an evaluation framework for detecting evasive behavior. This project contributes a practical, reproducible cybersecurity tool that supports incident response teams and analysts in safely studying emerging threats.

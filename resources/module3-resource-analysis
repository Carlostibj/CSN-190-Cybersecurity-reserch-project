Type: Academic Conference Paper
Synopsis (≤100 words): Introduces BareCloud, a bare-metal dynamic analysis system that minimizes sandbox detectability by avoiding in-guest monitors. Compares behavior on bare-metal versus common virtualized sandboxes to expose evasion. Strong design guidance for building a more transparent sandbox; main limitation is setup complexity and older dataset.
